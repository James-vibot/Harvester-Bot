# Harvester-Bot
The project is based on Firebird V Robot and Raspberry Pi Model B. The robot recognizes the fruit placed on a tree using digital image processing with the help of a USB camera mounted on the robot. Serial Communication occurs between Firebird V robot and R-Pi.  The fruit was then picked up by the Robotic Arm made by using Servo motors. The robot then travels a grid autonomously, following a line using white-line sensors to find the shortest path and finally reach the destination, where it deposits the fruit. The project was among top 9 in e-Yantra 2017.

## Image Processing
The "fruit_detectTask4.py" file detects the fruits in real-time via camera  mounted on the bot.

## Complete Task
This folder contains arduino codes for complete traversal of the arena.
